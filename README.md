## Abstract
This application is a rotten tomatoes clone. It supports user interactions through a multi-page experience.

The user has the capabilities to view all movies, select favorite movies, and view just those movies. They may view movie details such as release date and add comments to each movie.

The user may delete their score and the User Interface is updated seamlessly. 

## Learning Goals
- Reinforce React fundamentals
- Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing
- Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests
- Create a microserver using Express.js

### Wins
- Finishing the functionality of the project with time to spare
- Using a new technology, express, to set up interactions with node.js
- Using stateful class components to transfer data
- Adhering to RESTful design principles for routing

### Future Iterations..
- Write a more robust testing suite with more integration tests verifying user interaction.
- Finish error handling to print errors to the DOM.
- Upload microserver to heroku so data will persist
